# Date System

In Ancient Rome, instead of using a date system where days are counted from the 1st day of each month `(e.g., 16th of May, because it's been 16 days in May)`, Romans relied of counting the days that were left until the next important date. These dates were called, in plural feminine accusative case, `Kalendas`, `Nonas` and `Idus`.

### Important Dates

- **Kalendas**, which is the **1st** day of all months (Kalendis in Abblative form); 
- **Nonas**, which is usually the **5th** day, but the **7th** day in March, May, July and October (Nonis in Abblative form);
- **Idus**, which is usually the **13th** day, but the **15th** day in March, May, July and October (Idibus in Abblative form).

### Formulate a date

> ante diem + missing days to next important date + important date with its month + year

This might looking daunting at fist, but let's break it down:

# Reference Sheet

### Months in Roman (after 8 B.C.)

| **English**          | January   | February   | March   | April   | May   | June   |
|----------------------|-----------|------------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Latin**            | Ianuarius | Februarius | Martius | Aprilis | Maius | Iunius |
| **Accusitive**       | Ianurias  | Februarias | Martias | Aprilis | Maias | Iunias |

| **English**          | July   | August   | September  | October  | November  | December  |
|----------------------|--------|----------|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Latin**            | Iulius | Augustus | September  | October  | November  | December  |
| **Accusitive**       | Iulias | Augustas | Septembres | Octobres | Novembres | Decembres |

From my understanding, one should use the Plural Feminine Accusative case when **not on** an important date, and the Plural Feminine Ablative case when **on** an important date.

# FAQ

> **Question:** How do I read Roman Numerals?

**Answer:** To read a Roman Numeral (e.g., XXV), we use I, V, X, L, C and M to simbolize 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 respectively. Then, they're written from the largest to the smallest, left to right, so `XXV` corresponds to `X(10)` + `X(10)` + `V(5)` = `25`. 

The exception to this rule is that Romans wouldn't write the same symbol four times in a row, and therefore we also need to use subraction. Thus, when the largest from smallest order is not upheld, it means a subtraction is at hand. For example, `XIX` is `X(10)` - `I(10)` + `X(10)` = 19, because I < X, and the X is to the right of it.
