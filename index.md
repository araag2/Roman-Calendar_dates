# Date System

In Ancient Rome, instead of using a date system where days are counted from the 1st day of each month '(e.g., 16th of May, because it's been 16 days in May)', Romans relied of counting the days that were left until the next important date. These dates were called, in plural accusative case, 'Kalendas', 'Nonas' and 'Idus'.

# FAQ

> **Question:** How do I read Roman Numerals?

**Answer:** To read a Roman Numeral (e.g., XXV), we use I, V, X, L, C and M to simbolize 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 respectively. Then, they're written from the largest to the smallest, left to right, so 'XXV' corresponds to 'X(10)' + 'X(10)' + 'V(5)' = '25'.

The exception to this rule is that Romans wouldn't write the same symbol four times in a row, and therefore we also need to use subraction. Thus, when the largest from smallest order is not upheld, it means a subtraction is at hand. For example, 'XIX' is 'X(10)' - 'I(10)' + 'X(10)' = 19, because I < X, and the X is to the right of it.
