## FAQ

> How do I convert Roman Numerals?

**A:** To read a Roman Numeral (e.g., XXV), we use I, V, X, L, C and M to simbolize 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 respectively. Then, they're written from the largest to the smallest, left to right, so 'XXV' correspondes to 'X(10)' + 'X(10)' + 'V(5)' = '25'. 

The exception to this rule is that Romans wouldn't write the same symbol four times in a row, and therefore we also need to use subraction. Thus, when the largest from smallest order is not upheld, it means a subtraction is at hand. For example, 'XIX' is 'X(10)' - 'I(10)' + 'X(10)' = 19, because I < X, and the X is to the right of it.
